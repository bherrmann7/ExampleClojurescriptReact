# wap

A simple example to show some clojurescript react stuff

# To Tinker

    $ lein run
    $ lein figwheel

Then access the application at http://localhost:3000  and edit the code with your favorite editor.    Changes should update immetiately in the running app.


# How was this project built?

I used

    lein new luminus wap +war +cljs

to create an empty project, then I fiddled until I liked it.  Then
pushed to github.   luminus is a bit heavy for such a simple demo, but it was a brease to get going.    http://www.luminusweb.net/
